Welcome to Python Telegram Bot's documentation!

Guides and tutorials
====================

If you're just starting out with the library, we recommend following our `"Your first Bot" <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Extensions-%E2%80%93-Your-first-Bot>`_ tutorial that you can find on our `wiki <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki>`_.
While being there, you will also find guides to learn how to use handlers, webhooks, proxies, making your bot persistent, and much more.

Examples
========

A great way to learn is by looking at examples. Ours can be found in our `examples folder on Github <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/examples#examples>`_.
