    """
    Represents the content of a invoice message to be sent as the result of an inline query.

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`title`, :attr:`description`, :attr:`payload`,
    :attr:`currency` and :attr:`prices` are equal.

    .. versionadded:: 13.5
    .. versionchanged:: 21.11
       :attr:`provider_token` is no longer considered for equality comparison.

    Args:
        title (:obj:`str`): Product name. :tg-const:`telegram.Invoice.MIN_TITLE_LENGTH`-
            :tg-const:`telegram.Invoice.MAX_TITLE_LENGTH` characters.
        description (:obj:`str`): Product description.
            :tg-const:`telegram.Invoice.MIN_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`-
            :tg-const:`telegram.Invoice.MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH` characters.
        payload (:obj:`str`): Bot-defined invoice payload.
            :tg-const:`telegram.Invoice.MIN_PAYLOAD_LENGTH`-
            :tg-const:`telegram.Invoice.MAX_PAYLOAD_LENGTH` bytes. This will not be displayed
            to the user, use it for your internal processes.
        provider_token (:obj:`str`, optional): Payment provider token, obtained via
            `@Botfather <https://t.me/Botfather>`_. Pass an empty string for payments in
            |tg_stars|.

            .. versionchanged:: 21.11
                Bot API 7.4 made this parameter is optional and this is now reflected in the
                class signature.
        currency (:obj:`str`): Three-letter ISO 4217 currency code, see more on
            `currencies <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#supported-currencies>`_.
            Pass ``XTR`` for payments in |tg_stars|.
        prices (Sequence[:class:`telegram.LabeledPrice`]): Price breakdown, a list of
            components (e.g. product price, tax, discount, delivery cost, delivery tax, bonus,
            etc.). Must contain exactly one item for payments in |tg_stars|.

            .. versionchanged:: 20.0
                |sequenceclassargs|

        max_tip_amount (:obj:`int`, optional): The maximum accepted amount for tips in the
            *smallest units* of the currency (integer, **not** float/double). For example, for a
            maximum tip of ``US$ 1.45`` pass ``max_tip_amount = 145``. See the ``exp`` parameter in
            `currencies.json <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments/currencies.json>`_, it
            shows the number of digits past the decimal point for each currency (2 for the majority
            of currencies). Defaults to ``0``. Not supported for payments in |tg_stars|.
        suggested_tip_amounts (Sequence[:obj:`int`], optional): An array of suggested
            amounts of tip in the *smallest units* of the currency (integer, **not** float/double).
            At most 4 suggested tip amounts can be specified. The suggested tip amounts must be
            positive, passed in a strictly increased order and must not exceed
            :attr:`max_tip_amount`.

        photo_width (:obj:`int`, optional): Photo width.
        photo_height (:obj:`int`, optional): Photo height.
