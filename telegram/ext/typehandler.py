from .handler import Handler


class TypeHandler(Handler):
    """Handler class to handle updates of custom types.

    Attributes:
        type (:obj:`type`): The ``type`` of updates this handler should process.
        callback (:obj:`callable`): The callback function for this handler.
        strict (:obj:`bool`): Use ``type`` instead of ``isinstance``. Default is ``False``.
        pass_update_queue (:obj:`bool`): Determines whether ``update_queue`` will be
            passed to the callback function.
        pass_job_queue (:obj:`bool`): Determines whether ``job_queue`` will be passed to
            the callback function.

    Args:
        type (:obj:`type`): The ``type`` of updates this handler should process, as
            determined by ``isinstance``
        callback (:obj:`callable`): The callback function for this handler. Will be called when
            :attr:`check_update` has determined that an update should be processed by this handler.
            Callback signature for context based API:

            ``def callback(update: Update, context: CallbackContext)``

            The return value of the callback is usually ignored except for the special case of
            :class:`telegram.ext.ConversationHandler`.
        strict (:obj:`bool`, optional): Use ``type`` instead of ``isinstance``.
            Default is ``False``
        pass_update_queue (:obj:`bool`, optional): If set to ``True``, a keyword argument called
            ``update_queue`` will be passed to the callback function. It will be the ``Queue``
            instance used by the :class:`telegram.ext.Updater` and :class:`telegram.ext.Dispatcher`
            that contains new updates which can be used to insert updates. Default is ``False``.
            DEPRECATED: Please switch to context based callbacks.
        pass_job_queue (:obj:`bool`, optional): If set to ``True``, a keyword argument called
            ``job_queue`` will be passed to the callback function. It will be a
            :class:`telegram.ext.JobQueue` instance created by the :class:`telegram.ext.Updater`
            which can be used to schedule new jobs. Default is ``False``.
            DEPRECATED: Please switch to context based callbacks.
