    """
    A handler to hold a conversation with a single or multiple users through Telegram updates by
    managing three collections of other handlers.

    Warning:
        :class:`ConversationHandler` heavily relies on incoming updates being processed one by one.
        When using this handler, :attr:`telegram.ext.ApplicationBuilder.concurrent_updates` should
        be set to :obj:`False`.

    Note:
        :class:`ConversationHandler` will only accept updates that are (subclass-)instances of
        :class:`telegram.Update`. This is, because depending on the :attr:`per_user` and
        :attr:`per_chat`, :class:`ConversationHandler` relies on
        :attr:`telegram.Update.effective_user` and/or :attr:`telegram.Update.effective_chat` in
        order to determine which conversation an update should belong to. For
        :attr:`per_message=True <per_message>`, :class:`ConversationHandler` uses
        :attr:`update.callback_query.message.message_id <telegram.Message.message_id>` when
        :attr:`per_chat=True <per_chat>` and
        :attr:`update.callback_query.inline_message_id <.CallbackQuery.inline_message_id>` when
        :attr:`per_chat=False <per_chat>`. For a more detailed explanation, please see our `FAQ`_.

        Finally, :class:`ConversationHandler`, does *not* handle (edited) channel posts.

    .. _`FAQ`: https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki\
        /Frequently-Asked-Questions#what-do-the-per_-settings-in-conversation handler-do

    The first collection, a :obj:`list` named :attr:`entry_points`, is used to initiate the
    conversation, for example with a :class:`telegram.ext.CommandHandler` or
    :class:`telegram.ext.MessageHandler`.

    The second collection, a :obj:`dict` named :attr:`states`, contains the different conversation
    steps and one or more associated handlers that should be used if the user sends a message when
    the conversation with them is currently in that state. Here you can also define a state for
    :attr:`TIMEOUT` to define the behavior when :attr:`conversation_timeout` is exceeded, and a
    state for :attr:`WAITING` to define behavior when a new update is received while the previous
    :attr:`block=False <block>` handler is not finished.

    The third collection, a :obj:`list` named :attr:`fallbacks`, is used if the user is currently
    in a conversation but the state has either no associated handler or the handler that is
    associated to the state is inappropriate for the update, for example if the update contains a
    command, but a regular text message is expected. You could use this for a ``/cancel`` command
    or to let the user know their message was not recognized.

    To change the state of conversation, the callback function of a handler must return the new
    state after responding to the user. If it does not return anything (returning :obj:`None` by
    default), the state will not change. If an entry point callback function returns :obj:`None`,
    the conversation ends immediately after the execution of this callback function.
    To end the conversation, the callback function must return :attr:`END` or ``-1``. To
    handle the conversation timeout, use handler :attr:`TIMEOUT` or ``-2``.
    Finally, :class:`telegram.ext.ApplicationHandlerStop` can be used in conversations as described
    in its documentation.

    Note:
        In each of the described collections of handlers, a handler may in turn be a
        :class:`ConversationHandler`. In that case, the child :class:`ConversationHandler` should
        have the attribute :attr:`map_to_parent` which allows returning to the parent conversation
        at specified states within the child conversation.

        Note that the keys in :attr:`map_to_parent` must not appear as keys in :attr:`states`
        attribute or else the latter will be ignored. You may map :attr:`END` to one of the parents
        states to continue the parent conversation after the child conversation has ended or even
        map a state to :attr:`END` to end the *parent* conversation from within the child
        conversation. For an example on nested :class:`ConversationHandler` s, see
        :any:`examples.nestedconversationbot`.

    Examples:
        * :any:`Conversation Bot <examples.conversationbot>`
        * :any:`Conversation Bot 2 <examples.conversationbot2>`
        * :any:`Nested Conversation Bot <examples.nestedconversationbot>`
        * :any:`Persistent Conversation Bot <examples.persistentconversationbot>`

    Args:
        entry_points (list[:class:`telegram.ext.BaseHandler`]): A list of :obj:`BaseHandler`
            objects that
            can trigger the start of the conversation. The first handler whose :meth:`check_update`
            method returns :obj:`True` will be used. If all return :obj:`False`, the update is not
            handled.
        states (dict[:obj:`object`, list[:class:`telegram.ext.BaseHandler`]]): A :obj:`dict` that
            defines the different states of conversation a user can be in and one or more
            associated :obj:`BaseHandler` objects that should be used in that state. The first
            handler whose :meth:`check_update` method returns :obj:`True` will be used.
        fallbacks (list[:class:`telegram.ext.BaseHandler`]): A list of handlers that might be used
            if the user is in a conversation, but every handler for their current state returned
            :obj:`False` on :meth:`check_update`. The first handler which :meth:`check_update`
            method returns :obj:`True` will be used. If all return :obj:`False`, the update is not
            handled.
        allow_reentry (:obj:`bool`, optional): If set to :obj:`True`, a user that is currently in a
            conversation can restart the conversation by triggering one of the entry points.
            Default is :obj:`False`.
        per_chat (:obj:`bool`, optional): If the conversation key should contain the Chat's ID.
            Default is :obj:`True`.
        per_user (:obj:`bool`, optional): If the conversation key should contain the User's ID.
            Default is :obj:`True`.
        per_message (:obj:`bool`, optional): If the conversation key should contain the Message's
            ID. Default is :obj:`False`.
        conversation_timeout (:obj:`float` | :obj:`datetime.timedelta`, optional): When this
            handler is inactive more than this timeout (in seconds), it will be automatically
            ended. If this value is ``0`` or :obj:`None` (default), there will be no timeout. The
            last received update and the corresponding :class:`context <.CallbackContext>` will be
            handled by *ALL* the handler's whose :meth:`check_update` method returns :obj:`True`
            that are in the state :attr:`ConversationHandler.TIMEOUT`.

            Caution:
                * This feature relies on the :attr:`telegram.ext.Application.job_queue` being set
                  and hence requires that the dependencies that :class:`telegram.ext.JobQueue`
                  relies on are installed.
                * Using :paramref:`conversation_timeout` with nested conversations is currently
                  not supported. You can still try to use it, but it will likely behave
                  differently from what you expect.

        name (:obj:`str`, optional): The name for this conversation handler. Required for
            persistence.
        persistent (:obj:`bool`, optional): If the conversation's dict for this handler should be
            saved. :paramref:`name` is required and persistence has to be set in
            :attr:`Application <.Application.persistence>`.

            .. versionchanged:: 20.0
                Was previously named as ``persistence``.
        map_to_parent (dict[:obj:`object`, :obj:`object`], optional): A :obj:`dict` that can be
            used to instruct a child conversation handler to transition into a mapped state on
            its parent conversation handler in place of a specified nested state.
        block (:obj:`bool`, optional): Pass :obj:`False` or :obj:`True` to set a default value for
            the :attr:`BaseHandler.block` setting of all handlers (in :attr:`entry_points`,
            :attr:`states` and :attr:`fallbacks`). The resolution order for checking if a handler
            should be run non-blocking is:

            1. :attr:`telegram.ext.BaseHandler.block` (if set)
            2. the value passed to this parameter (if any)
            3. :attr:`telegram.ext.Defaults.block` (if defaults are used)

            .. seealso:: :wiki:`Concurrency`

            .. versionchanged:: 20.0
                No longer overrides the handlers settings. Resolution order was changed.

    Raises:
        :exc:`ValueError`: If :paramref:`persistent` is used but :paramref:`name` was not set, or
            when :attr:`per_message`, :attr:`per_chat`, :attr:`per_user` are all :obj:`False`.

    Attributes:
        block (:obj:`bool`): Determines whether the callback will run in a blocking way. Always
            :obj:`True` since conversation handlers handle any non-blocking callbacks internally.
