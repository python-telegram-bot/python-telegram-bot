    """The base class for all update handlers. Create custom handlers by inheriting from it.

    Warning:
        When setting :paramref:`block` to :obj:`False`, you cannot rely on adding custom
        attributes to :class:`telegram.ext.CallbackContext`. See its docs for more info.

    This class is a :class:`~typing.Generic` class and accepts two type variables:

    1. The type of the updates that this handler will handle. Must coincide with the type of the
       first argument of :paramref:`callback`. :meth:`check_update` must only accept
       updates of this type.
    2. The type of the second argument of :paramref:`callback`. Must coincide with the type of the
       parameters :paramref:`handle_update.context` and
       :paramref:`collect_additional_context.context` as well as the second argument of
       :paramref:`callback`. Must be either :class:`~telegram.ext.CallbackContext` or a subclass
       of that class.

       .. tip::
           For this type variable, one should usually provide a :class:`~typing.TypeVar` that is
           also used for the mentioned method arguments. That way, a type checker can check whether
           this handler fits the definition of the :class:`~Application`.

    .. seealso:: :wiki:`Types of Handlers <Types-of-Handlers>`

    .. versionchanged:: 20.0

        * The attribute ``run_async`` is now :paramref:`block`.
        * This class was previously named ``Handler``.

    Args:
        callback (:term:`coroutine function`): The callback function for this handler. Will be
            called when :meth:`check_update` has determined that an update should be processed by
            this handler. Callback signature::

                async def callback(update: Update, context: CallbackContext)

            The return value of the callback is usually ignored except for the special case of
            :class:`telegram.ext.ConversationHandler`.
        block (:obj:`bool`, optional): Determines whether the return value of the callback should
            be awaited before processing the next handler in
            :meth:`telegram.ext.Application.process_update`. Defaults to :obj:`True`.

            .. seealso:: :wiki:`Concurrency`

    Attributes:
        callback (:term:`coroutine function`): The callback function for this handler.
        block (:obj:`bool`): Determines whether the callback will run in a blocking way.
