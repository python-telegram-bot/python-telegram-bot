    Currently, the following 6 types of chat members are supported:

    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberMember`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberRestricted`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberLeft`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberBanned`

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`user` and :attr:`status` are equal.

    Examples:
        :any:`Chat Member Bot <examples.chatmemberbot>`

          Therefore, most of the arguments and attributes were removed and you should no longer
          use :class:`ChatMember` directly.
        * The constant ``ChatMember.CREATOR`` was replaced by :attr:`~telegram.ChatMember.OWNER`
