    This is a non-blocking and non-threaded resolver.  It is

    `~tornado.netutil.Resolver` and
    `~tornado.netutil.DefaultExecutorResolver`.  Specifically, it returns at
    most one result, and arguments other than ``host`` and ``family``
    are ignored.  It may fail to resolve when ``family`` is not
    ``socket.AF_UNSPEC``.

    Requires Twisted 12.1 or newer.
