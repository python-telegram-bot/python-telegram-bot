        amount (:obj:`int`): Price of the product in the smallest units of the currency (integer,
            not float/double). For example, for a price of US$ 1.45 pass ``amount = 145``.
            See the :obj:`exp` parameter in
            `currencies.json <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments/currencies.json>`_,
            it shows the number of digits past the decimal point for each currency
