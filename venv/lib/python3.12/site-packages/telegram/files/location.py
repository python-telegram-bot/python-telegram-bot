    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`longitute` and :attr:`latitude` are equal.

    Args:
        longitude (:obj:`float`): Longitude as defined by sender.
        latitude (:obj:`float`): Latitude as defined by sender.
        horizontal_accuracy (:obj:`float`, optional): The radius of uncertainty for the location,
            measured in meters; 0-1500.
        live_period (:obj:`int`, optional): Time relative to the message sending date, during which
            the location can be updated, in seconds. For active live locations only.
        heading (:obj:`int`, optional): The direction in which user is moving, in degrees; 1-360.
            For active live locations only.
        proximity_alert_radius (:obj:`int`, optional): Maximum distance for proximity alerts about
            approaching another chat member, in meters. For sent live locations only.
        **kwargs (:obj:`dict`): Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Attributes:
        longitude (:obj:`float`): Longitude as defined by sender.
        latitude (:obj:`float`): Latitude as defined by sender.
        horizontal_accuracy (:obj:`float`): Optional. The radius of uncertainty for the location,
            measured in meters.
        live_period (:obj:`int`): Optional. Time relative to the message sending date, during which
            the location can be updated, in seconds. For active live locations only.
        heading (:obj:`int`): Optional. The direction in which user is moving, in degrees.
