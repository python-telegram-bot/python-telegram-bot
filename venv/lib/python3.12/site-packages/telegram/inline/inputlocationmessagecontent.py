    Represents the content of a location message to be sent as the result of an inline query.

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`latitude` and :attr:`longitude` are equal.

    Args:
        latitude (:obj:`float`): Latitude of the location in degrees.
        longitude (:obj:`float`): Longitude of the location in degrees.
        horizontal_accuracy (:obj:`float`, optional): The radius of uncertainty for the location,
            measured in meters; 0-1500.
        live_period	(:obj:`int`, optional): Period in seconds for which the location can be
            updated, should be between 60 and 86400.
        heading (:obj:`int`, optional): For live locations, a direction in which the user is
            moving, in degrees. Must be between 1 and 360 if specified.
        proximity_alert_radius (:obj:`int`, optional): For live locations, a maximum distance for
            proximity alerts about approaching another chat member, in meters. Must be between 1
            and 100000 if specified.
        **kwargs (:obj:`dict`): Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Attributes:
        latitude (:obj:`float`): Latitude of the location in degrees.
        longitude (:obj:`float`): Longitude of the location in degrees.
        horizontal_accuracy (:obj:`float`): Optional. The radius of uncertainty for the location,
            measured in meters.
        live_period	(:obj:`int`): Optional. Period in seconds for which the location can be
            updated.
        heading (:obj:`int`): Optional. For live locations, a direction in which the user is
            moving, in degrees.
        proximity_alert_radius (:obj:`int`): Optional. For live locations, a maximum distance for
            proximity alerts about approaching another chat member, in meters.
