class ChatMember(TelegramObject):
    """Base class for Telegram ChatMember Objects.
    Currently, the following 6 types of chat members are supported:

    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberOwner`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberAdministrator`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberMember`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberRestricted`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberLeft`
    * :class:`telegram.ChatMemberBanned`

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`user` and :attr:`status` are equal.

    Note:
        As of Bot API 5.3, :class:`ChatMember` is nothing but the base class for the subclasses
        listed above and is no longer returned directly by :meth:`~telegram.Bot.get_chat`.
        Therefore, most of the arguments and attributes were deprecated and you should no longer
        use :class:`ChatMember` directly.

    Args:
        user (:class:`telegram.User`): Information about the user.
        status (:obj:`str`): The member's status in the chat. Can be

            :attr:`~telegram.ChatMember.MEMBER` or :attr:`~telegram.ChatMember.RESTRICTED`.
