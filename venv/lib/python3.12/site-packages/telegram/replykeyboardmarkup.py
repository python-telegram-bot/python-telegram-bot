    """This object represents a custom keyboard with reply options.

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their the size of :attr:`keyboard` and all the buttons are equal.

    Example:
        A user requests to change the bot's language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard
        to select the new language. Other users in the group don't see the keyboard.

    Args:
        keyboard (List[List[:obj:`str` | :class:`telegram.KeyboardButton`]]): Array of button rows,
                each represented by an Array of :class:`telegram.KeyboardButton` objects.
        resize_keyboard (:obj:`bool`, optional): Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically
            for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of
            buttons). Defaults to :obj:`False`, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the
            same height as the app's standard keyboard.
        one_time_keyboard (:obj:`bool`, optional): Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as
            it's been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically
            display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat - the user can press a special button in
            the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to :obj:`False`.
        selective (:obj:`bool`, optional): Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to
            specific users only. Targets:

            1) Users that are @mentioned in the :attr:`~telegram.Message.text` of the
               :class:`telegram.Message` object.
            2) If the bot's message is a reply (has ``reply_to_message_id``), sender of the
               original message.

            Defaults to :obj:`False`.

        input_field_placeholder (:obj:`str`, optional): The placeholder to be shown in the input
            field when the keyboard is active; 1-64 characters.

            .. versionadded:: 13.7

        **kwargs (:obj:`dict`): Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Attributes:
        keyboard (List[List[:class:`telegram.KeyboardButton` | :obj:`str`]]): Array of button rows.
        resize_keyboard (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Requests clients to resize the keyboard.
        one_time_keyboard (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as
            it's been used.
        selective (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Show the keyboard to specific users only.
        input_field_placeholder (:obj:`str`): Optional. The placeholder shown in the input
            field when the reply is active.
