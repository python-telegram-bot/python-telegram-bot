    Use as follows::

    If for example `__name__` is `telegram.ext._updater`, the logger will be named
    `telegram.ext.Updater`. If `class_name` is passed, this will result in
    `telegram.ext.<class_name>`. Useful e.g. for CamelCase class names.

    If the file name points to a utils module, the logger name will simply be `telegram(.ext)`.
