class InputFile:
    """This object represents a Telegram InputFile.

    .. versionchanged:: 20.0

        * The former attribute ``attach`` was renamed to :attr:`attach_name`.
        * Method ``is_image`` was removed. If you pass :obj:`bytes` to :paramref:`obj` and would
          like to have the mime type automatically guessed, please pass :paramref:`filename`
          in addition.

    Args:
        obj (:term:`file object` | :obj:`bytes` | :obj:`str`): An open file descriptor or the files
            content as bytes or string.

            Note:
                If :paramref:`obj` is a string, it will be encoded as bytes via
                :external:obj:`obj.encode('utf-8') <str.encode>`.

            .. versionchanged:: 20.0
                Accept string input.
        filename (:obj:`str`, optional): Filename for this InputFile.
        attach (:obj:`bool`, optional): Pass :obj:`True` if the parameter this file belongs to in
            the request to Telegram should point to the multipart data via an ``attach://`` URI.
            Defaults to `False`.
        read_file_handle (:obj:`bool`, optional): If :obj:`True` and :paramref:`obj` is a file
            handle, the data will be read from the file handle on initialization of this object.
            If :obj:`False`, the file handle will be passed on to the
            :attr:`networking backend <telegram.request.BaseRequest.do_request>` which will have
            to handle the reading. Defaults to :obj:`True`.

            Tip:
                If you upload extremely large files, you may want to set this to :obj:`False` to
                avoid reading the complete file into memory. Additionally, this may be supported
                better by the networking backend (in particular it is handled better by
                the default :class:`~telegram.request.HTTPXRequest`).

            Important:
                If you set this to :obj:`False`, you have to ensure that the file handle is still
                open when the request is made. In particular, the following snippet can *not* work
                as expected.

                .. code-block:: python

                    with open('file.txt', 'rb') as file:
                        input_file = InputFile(file, read_file_handle=False)

                    # here the file handle is already closed and the upload will fail
                    await bot.send_document(chat_id, input_file)

            .. versionadded:: 21.5


    Attributes:
        input_file_content (:obj:`bytes` | :class:`IO`): The binary content of the file to send.
        attach_name (:obj:`str`): Optional. If present, the parameter this file belongs to in
            the request to Telegram should point to the multipart data via a an URI of the form
            ``attach://<attach_name>`` URI.
        filename (:obj:`str`): Filename for the file to be sent.
        mimetype (:obj:`str`): The mimetype inferred from the file to be sent.
