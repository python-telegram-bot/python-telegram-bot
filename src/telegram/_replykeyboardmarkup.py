class ReplyKeyboardMarkup(TelegramObject):
    """This object represents a custom keyboard with reply options. Not supported in channels and
    for messages sent on behalf of a Telegram Business account.

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their size of :attr:`keyboard` and all the buttons are equal.

        0478c124d5914c23
        :align: center

        A reply keyboard with reply options.

    .. seealso::
        Another kind of keyboard would be the :class:`telegram.InlineKeyboardMarkup`.

    Examples:
        * Example usage: A user requests to change the bot's language, bot replies to the request
          with a keyboard to select the new language. Other users in the group don't see
          the keyboard.
        * :any:`Conversation Bot <examples.conversationbot>`
        * :any:`Conversation Bot 2 <examples.conversationbot2>`

    Args:
        keyboard (Sequence[Sequence[:obj:`str` | :class:`telegram.KeyboardButton`]]): Array of
            button rows, each represented by an Array of :class:`telegram.KeyboardButton` objects.
        resize_keyboard (:obj:`bool`, optional): Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically
            for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of
            buttons). Defaults to :obj:`False`, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the
            same height as the app's standard keyboard.
        one_time_keyboard (:obj:`bool`, optional): Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as
            it's been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically
            display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat - the user can press a special button in
            the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to :obj:`False`.
        selective (:obj:`bool`, optional): Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to
            specific users only. Targets:

            1) Users that are @mentioned in the :attr:`~telegram.Message.text` of the
               :class:`telegram.Message` object.
            2) If the bot's message is a reply to a message in the same chat and forum topic,
                sender of the original message.

            Defaults to :obj:`False`.

        input_field_placeholder (:obj:`str`, optional): The placeholder to be shown in the input
            field when the keyboard is active;
            :tg-const:`telegram.ReplyKeyboardMarkup.MIN_INPUT_FIELD_PLACEHOLDER`-
            :tg-const:`telegram.ReplyKeyboardMarkup.MAX_INPUT_FIELD_PLACEHOLDER`
            characters.

            .. versionadded:: 13.7
        is_persistent (:obj:`bool`, optional): Requests clients to always show the keyboard when
            the regular keyboard is hidden. Defaults to :obj:`False`, in which case the custom
            keyboard can be hidden and opened with a keyboard icon.

            .. versionadded:: 20.0

    Attributes:
        keyboard (tuple[tuple[:class:`telegram.KeyboardButton`]]): Array of button rows,
            each represented by an Array of :class:`telegram.KeyboardButton` objects.
        resize_keyboard (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically
            for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of
            buttons). Defaults to :obj:`False`, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the
            same height as the app's standard keyboard.

               :class:`telegram.Message` object.
            2) If the bot's message is a reply to a message in the same chat and forum topic,
                sender of the original message.

            Defaults to :obj:`False`.

            field when the keyboard is active;

            characters.

            .. versionadded:: 13.7
        is_persistent (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Requests clients to always show the keyboard when
            the regular keyboard is hidden. If :obj:`False`, the custom keyboard can be hidden and
