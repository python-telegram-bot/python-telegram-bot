    This class represents a topic for direct messages in a chat.

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`topic_id` and :attr:`user` is equal.

    .. versionadded:: 22.4

    Args:
        topic_id (:obj:`int`): Unique identifier of the topic. This number may have more than 32
            significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in
            interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or
            double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
        user (:class:`telegram.User`, optional): Information about the user that created the topic.

            .. hint::
                According to Telegram, this field is always present as of Bot API 9.2.

    Attributes:
        topic_id (:obj:`int`): Unique identifier of the topic. This number may have more than 32
