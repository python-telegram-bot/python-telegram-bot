    This object represents a service message about a user allowing a bot to write messages after
    adding it to the attachment menu, launching a Web App from a link, or accepting an explicit
    request from a Web App sent by the method
    `requestWriteAccess <https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#initializing-mini-apps>`_.

    Objects of this class are comparable in terms of equality. Two objects of this class are
    considered equal, if their :attr:`web_app_name` is equal.
