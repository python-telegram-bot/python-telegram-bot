This includes the following:

- Deprecated the class ``telegram.constants.StarTransactions``. Its only member ``telegram.constants.StarTransactions.NANOSTAR_VALUE`` will be replaced by ``telegram.constants.Nanostar.VALUE``.
- Bot API 9.0 deprecated ``BusinessConnection.can_reply`` in favor of ``BusinessConnection.rights``
- Bot API 9.0 deprecated ``ChatFullInfo.can_send_gift`` in favor of ``ChatFullInfo.accepted_gift_types``.

These deprecations are backward compatible, but we strongly recommend to update your code to use the new members.
